
JavaScript Target for S2
------------------------

The JavaScript target compiles layers to JavaScript code which can then
be used in situations where a JavaScript interpreter is available, such
as in a web browser.

It has been used, albeit only as a tech demo, to do in-browser,
client-side rendering of S2 styles for real-time previews during
style customization.

This target is experimental, and has not been used in any production
applications. Its runtime library and API are also subject to change
in future, which may break existing apps and require layers to be
recompiled.

To use:
    s2compile --output javascript --layervar layer ...

The "layervar" parameter specifies the name of a variable that should
recieve the layer object at runtime. The intention is that applications
will compile each layer to a separate JavaScript source file, and then
(for in-browser JavaScript, for example) load each layer in turn before
using them:

<script language="JavaScript" href="s2runtime.js"></script>
<script language="JavaScript" href="core.js"></script>
<script language="JavaScript" href="layout.js"></script>
<script language="JavaScript">

// core.js loaded the core layer into variable "core"
// layout.js loaded the core layer into variable "layout"
var ctx = new s2.Context(core, layout);
ctx.setPrint(document.write);
ctx.runFunction("main()");

</script>
