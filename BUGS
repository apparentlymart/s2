- precedence/parsing fucked with things like:
      println (isnull $test ? "It's null" : "not null");
  have to write:
      println ((isnull $test) ? "It's null" : "not null");

- HTML backend will escape quotes in tripled quoted
  TokenStringLiterals that weren't escaped originally

- in a foreach statement when iterating over hash keys,
  you can extract them as ints or strings, regardless of
  what they actually are.  for the perl backend, this 
  doesn't really matter, but a better solution might have
  to be found sometime.

- builtin functions can't be overridden by S2 functions 
  in subclasses?  (look into this again)

- Confusing message when trying to interpolate an object without
  a toString() method:
      "Right hand side of + operator is Color, not a string or
       integer at line 28, column 16"

TODO:

- don't make vardecls in foreach stmts require the type.  infer it
  instead from the listexpr type minus an arrayref

- static variables

- constructors with arguments

- 'readonly' class members

- private functions/members

GOTCHAS:

- this might be considered a bug:

    function foo():string{ print "hi"; }

  won't parse.  the { after 'string' is parsed as part of the return
  type.  whitespace is required in there.

  UPDATE: mart says this isn't a bug.  :)
