The layerinfo keys & values can for the most part be whatever you want.

However, some are either required or recommended:

REQUIRED:
         type   =  must be core, i18nc, layout, theme, i18n, or user.
         name   =  shown in selection on the website.
         majorversion = all core layers must have integer majorversion.  see versioning.txt

RECOMMENDED:
	author_name
	author_email
	des		= description

MAGIC:

       uniqname = When layers are redistributed, they need a uniqname
              that never changes so they can be found and upgraded on
              any installation, regardless of that system's system
              account userid and s2lid values.  the compiler or web
              tool doesn't enforce this.  it's just handled by
              redist.pl (called by update-db.pl).  this value should
              have no spaces or funky characters, since it'll be a filename
              on disk.  that is, it should be in /^\w{1,25}$/
              the uniqname should be prefixed by "loc" if it's a site
              local layer, so the namespaces don't conflict.  this is
              just convention, though; not enforced or used in any tools.

        scope = used by `redist.pl --write` to decide which system
              styles go in redist.dat and which go in redist-local.dat.
              by default, scope of system stuff is "general" unless
              declared "local"
