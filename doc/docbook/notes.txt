S2 Manual Notes:
----------------

Build:
------
  The source to this manual is straight DocBook, with no extra compilation required
  beforehand, unlike the LiveJournal and FotoBilder manuals. For our projects we use
  libxslt to parse, validate, and compile the manuals, and Debian as our OS of choice.

  To compile the docs for yourself on Debian, you need the following packages:
  * xsltproc
  * docbook-xml
  * docbook-xsl

  The command we use is 'xsltproc', like so:
  xsltproc --nonet xsl-docbook/html/chunk.xsl index.xml

Semantics:
----------
  The common DocBook elements we use are:
  classname
    inline, names of S2 classes
  methodname
    inline, names of S2 class methods
  function
    inline, names of global functions
  varname
    inline, names of misc variables
