
perloo - Object-oriented Perl Target for S2
-------------------------------------------

The S2 compiler's Perl backend traditionally generates code which depends on
a global S2 package, which itself maintains state in global variables. This
runtime is fast, but it has some drawbacks:

    * It isn't fully re-entrant
    * Caller has to know/think about layerids even if the layers aren't
     being stored in a database.
    * The API's just a bit ugly in general.

perloo is a new mode for the Perl backend accompanied by a new runtime which
generates object-oriented Perl code. Its goals are to rectify all of the above
listed problems while retaining the speed as much as possible. The new
embedding API is similar to that offered by the experimental JavaScript and
Lua targets.

At this point the perloo target should be considered experimental. It hasn't
yet been tested in any real world applications and it lacks some of the
optimizations present in the traditional perl target.

To use:
    s2compile --output perloo ...
    
When targeting perloo, the --layerid parameter is not required and is
ignored.

For information on the runtime library, please refer to the source code which
currently includes rudimentary POD that will be expanded on later.
